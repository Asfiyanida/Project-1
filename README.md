DSBA projects
Project 1

The objective of the project was to extract the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help business to enhance the customer experience.

* Core business idea - Online food delivery service is a great option for students and busy professionals because of their hectic lifestyles.
* Problem to tackle â€“ People are more busy during weekdays and hence company must focus to improve the delivery time of the order

Business Insights from this project:
From the observation, we can conclude the following:
1. Overall rating for the restaurants starts from 3 and goes until 5.
2. Many customers are ordering food during weekends and the ratings are high during weekends compared to weekdays.
3. Most of the customers prefer to order American cuisine among other cuisine types.
4. Maximum number of orders are placed in these restaurants which are top 5 restaurants with maximum ratings, and they 
are:
* Shake Shack 
* The Meatball Shop 
* Blue Ribbon Sushi 
* Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken 
* Parm
5. In the top 5 restaurants given , many customers prefer to order American,Japanese & Italian.
6. The bottom 5 preferred cuisine types are Vietnamese, Spanish ,Thai, Korean and French

Recommendations:
1. Weekend orders are high and by this analysis we need to ensure that there are more delivery 
person available to deliver the orders even more quicker, by this we can get more rating from the 
customers
2. 2. The bottom 5 preferred cuisines can be ruled out from the app if not performing well, or gather 
more data in terms of cost vs profit to take further decisions.
3. 3. The top 5 restaurants which are performing well can give more discount to attract more customers
4. 4. Though the number of orders are less during weekdays more time is taken to deliver the food when 
compared with weekends and hence over here analysis must be done


There is also a business presentation of this project and the data is visualized using PowerBI tool which is attached in this repository.
